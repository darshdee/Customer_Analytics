# Customer Analytics

### Overview
In this project, I focus on analyzing datasets pertaining to two key metrics observed in the customer analytics domain, namely: Customer Lifetime Value & Sales from marketing campaigns . Briefly, these two metrics are explained below: 

- Customer Lifetime Value : One of the most vital metrics observed at growing companies, Customer Lifetime Value or CLTV, refers to the total monetary value to be gained from a customer throughout the customer's journey in the company's ecosystem.

- Marketing Campaigns: Marketing campaigns promote products or services through different types of media, such as television, print, and online platforms such as social media (Source). Marketing campaigns are repurposed for specific goals. For instance: some marketing campaigns focus on improving brand image while others focus on a more tangible return such as prompting target audience to sign up on a website or purchase a product.


### Approach
In this report, I follow the most common approach to conducting predictive analytics, such as :
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data wrangling, cleaning, & consolidation
- Statistical feature selection
- Feature engineering
- Predictive Model Development & Analysis
- Inference

### Goals
My goal(s) for this project involved not only exploring the datasets to yield interesting insights but also develop two predictive models and determine if they held any bearing as viable ways to fortell both CLTV values and the Sales values. The challenge here was that I was limited to this dataset alone, without having the opportunity to source external data to refine and improve upon my analysis. 

My analysis concluded with developing two models: a regression model to predict CLTV values and a classification model to determine Sales that were categorized into "proportional" bucket sizes. Following which I offer my insights and understanding of the same.
